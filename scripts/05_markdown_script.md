Markdown is a basic markup language designed to be displayed on the web. With a few basic commands, you can create polished documents that can be used to communicate your results to others and provide daily/weekly reports of your employer.

How do you use Markdown? If you know how to type you know how to use Markdown! Writing with Markdown is the exact same task as writing in a text editor like Microsoft Word. The only difference is that all the fancy buttons and options are removed and instead replaced with a series of commands that you can type to format your text. Here's a small example of what Markdown can do! You can see everything in this document is written as plain text, with just letters and basic symbols.

Now you can see how that text appears when it is rendered in Markdown. Even though it was created with plain text, it appears with italics, bolding, different sized text, and even an image!

Three major formatting basics of Markdown are headers, bold and italicized text, and lists. Headers help you separate sections of your document, bold or italicized format allows you to emphasize important points in your document, and lists help you orderly arrange your ideas. Headers are straightforward, you simply add a hash right before the text you want to make a header. Keep in mind the hash must be on the beginning of a new line (no text on the line before it). The more hashes you add before the text, the smaller the header will be. For example, here is a list of headers you can use ordered from largest to smallest. And the result when it is rendered in Markdown.

Creating bolded and italicized text is also very straightforward. Use a double asterisk before and after the text you want to be bold and a single asterisk before and after text you want to italicize. So in this example sentence what you want to bold is shown bolded and what you want to italicize is shown in italics.

Lists are a useful way to organize your ideas or tasks. In Markdown, you can make your lists numbered or non-numbered. To make a numbered list, just put the number and a period in front of the item. As with headers, you do need to make sure your first number is on a new line (no text on the line before it!) Here's an example of a numbered list with three items.

For non-numbered lists, you can use your choice of asterisks, pluses, or minuses to indicate list items. These three examples of typed lists all render to the same thing!

You can create sub-items for your list by indenting (using multiple spaces) before the number or the asterisk or plus or minus. Make the number or symbol of the sub-item line up with the text of the item above it. Here's an example of a list with sub-items and a combination of numbered and non-numbered items.

If you want to cross off items on your list (as you do them, perhaps) you can create a strike-through using double tildas. Here's an example of crossing two items from your list.

If you would like to do more complicated editing, there are many more text modifiers you can use for Markdown.

You will see some more of these commands later in this module, but you might want to bookmark this page now for future reference!

Links to content on the internet can be included in a Markdown document as well. The format for a link is to put what you want your link to say in square brackets followed immediately by the web address where the link should go inside of parentheses. For example if you want the link to go to www.google.com when clicked, then you'd replace the text in the parentheses and with www.google.com.

If you want to change the text of the link itself, you just change what's in the square brackets. For example, you might want the sentence If you don't know the answer, you should look it up on Google, where the word Google would be a link to www.google.com. You could do that by putting Google into square brackets, with the web address www.google.com following immediately in parentheses.
