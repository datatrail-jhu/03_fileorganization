# Navigating files in the Terminal

As was discussed in the first lesson of this course, one of the most important aspects of being a productive data scientist is staying organized. And a big part of staying organized is in knowing where your files are located. In these next few lessons, we will be getting you fluent in orienting yourself in file systems in two areas: the Terminal and R/RStudio.

## What is the Terminal?

The Terminal is an interface to the operating system of a computer. That is, it provides a way for you to type commands in order to perform actions on a computer. For example, there are commands to create new files and folders and to open files and folders. On your Chromebook, you are familiar with using your mouse to perform such actions. When you are working with data on RStudio Cloud, however, you will not be able to use your mouse for everything that you'll want to do. It will be important to become comfortable with the idea of a Terminal as a place for purely text-based commands. In RStudio Cloud, the Terminal is located in the tab next to the Console.
