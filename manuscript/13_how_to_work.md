# How to work

- Use raw folders 
- Code without constraint first
  - use comments to help
- Modular files
- README
- Moving to final version
  - file numbering
  - rmd files
  - Updated README
- Budget 20% of your time for this (will seem like a waste!)
  - Keep track with bulleted lists
  - A "journal" for each project
