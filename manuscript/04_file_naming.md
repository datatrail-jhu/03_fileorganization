# File naming

This is going to seem like a silly topic to have a whole lecture on. But one of the most frustrating things when looking at someone's data science project is to see a set of files that are completely scattered with names that don't make any sense. It also makes it harder to search for files if they don't have a consistent naming scheme. 



- three principles (jenny bryan)
  - machine readable
  - human readable
  - plays well with default ordering
- machine readble
  - avoid spaces, periods, etc. 
  - use underscores and dashes
  - use lowercase
  - use common "globs" to make it easy to search for files
  - separate globs into "information units"
- human readable
  - name should contain things on content ('slugs')
- default ordering
  - logical use numbers - remember to left pad
  - chronologoiical use dates YYYY-MM-DD
